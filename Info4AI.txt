Project Structure Information:

1. Battle System Components:
- Main battle screen: /components/battle/screens/BattleScreen.tsx
- Card component: /components/battle/components/CardComponent.tsx
- Battle context: /components/battle/contexts/BattleContext.tsx
- Card data and models: /components/battle/data/cardData.ts and /components/battle/models/Card.ts

2. Card Positioning:
- Cards are rendered in a horizontal ScrollView with flexDirection: 'row'
- Field cards use the fieldContainer style for positioning
- Card dimensions are responsive, calculated based on screen width:
  * Small: 25% of screen width
  * Medium: 35% of screen width
  * Large: 45% of screen width
  * Height is 1.4x the width (standard card aspect ratio)

3. Changes Made:
- Modified fieldContainer style in BattleScreen.tsx to better center cards:
  * Added justifyContent: 'center' for horizontal centering
  * Added alignItems: 'center' for vertical centering

4. Key UI Components:
- BattleScreen renders:
  * Opponent's hand (face down)
  * Game info (energy, deck counts)
  * Opponent's field
  * Game log
  * Player's field
  * Action buttons
  * Player's hand

This information will be helpful for future UI adjustments and understanding the battle system's structure.
