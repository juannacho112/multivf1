# VeeFriends Card Game - Multiplayer Integration Notes

## Objective
Align the multiplayer implementation with the single player battle card game to ensure they share UI components, game logic, and consistent user experience.

## Current Issues
1. Multiplayer "Ready" button throwing errors due to MongoDB schema validation issues with deck structure
2. Different game logic between single player and multiplayer modes
3. Inappropriate game lobby text referring to "3 energy and a hand of cards" which doesn't match the VeeFriends game mechanics
4. Need to standardize both implementations to use the same UI components and game flow

## Initial Analysis Steps
1. Examine single player battle components to understand the core game mechanics
2. Review multiplayer implementation to identify differences
3. Map out the required changes to align both implementations
4. Implement fixes while maintaining existing functionality

## TODO
- [x] Fix MongoDB validation error for card decks
- [ ] Examine single player battle logic
- [ ] Review multiplayer implementation
- [ ] Align game waiting room with VeeFriends game rules
- [ ] Standardize components between single player and multiplayer
- [ ] Implement deck selection options similar to single player mode
