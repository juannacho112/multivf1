# VeeFriends Multiplayer - Fixes & Implementation Notes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Newline Character Errors in Deck Data

Fixed MongoDB validation failures caused by newline characters in stringified deck data. The solution involved:

- **Enhanced Deck Schema Setter**: Improved the `deck` schema setter in `VeefriendsGame.js` to properly handle and clean stringified card arrays
- **Validation & Type Enforcement**: Added robust validation for card objects with proper type conversion
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error catching and logging for deck parsing issues
- **Cleanup Utility**: Created `cleanupDeckData.js` script to fix existing invalid deck data in the database

### 2. Game Mechanics Standardization

Updated game information and mechanics to match the single-player implementation:

- **Removed Energy-Based Game References**: Updated game descriptions to remove references to the 3-energy and card-hand mechanics
- **Standardized Game Mechanics**: Updated game descriptions to consistently refer to the skill/stamina/aura attributes and challenge-based gameplay
- **Game Info Update**: Updated the waiting room UI to display the correct game rules

## Implementation Details

### Card Schema Validation Fixes

The improved deck setter in `VeefriendsGame.js` now:

1. Thoroughly cleans stringified JSON input (removes newlines, tabs, carriage returns)
2. Validates the JSON format before parsing
3. Type-checks and normalizes each card property
4. Handles various edge cases (string concatenation artifacts, malformed input)

### Database Cleanup Utility

The `cleanupDeckData.js` script:

1. Connects to MongoDB using environment variables
2. Finds all VeeFriends game records
3. Processes each player's deck in each game:
   - Converts stringified decks to proper arrays
   - Validates and normalizes card data
   - Repairs or resets invalid deck data
4. Updates the database with fixed records
5. Provides detailed logs of changes made

A convenient `cleanup-db.sh` shell script is provided to easily run this utility.

## How to Use

### Running the Database Cleanup

```bash
# From the backend directory
./cleanup-db.sh
```

This will scan and fix all existing games that have invalid deck data.

### Testing the Fixes

1. Create a new multiplayer game
2. Verify both players can mark themselves as ready
3. Ensure the game starts properly with cards displayed
4. Verify all game phases work correctly (challenger picking attributes, accepting/denying, resolving challenges)

## Architecture Notes

The current implementation still has some technical debt that should be addressed in future updates:

1. **Shared Data Models**: Consider creating shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend
2. **Component Reuse**: Further refactor to maximize component reuse between single-player and multiplayer modes
3. **Code Consolidation**: Remove duplicated game logic between client and server
4. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling for socket events
5. **Logging**: Add more comprehensive logging for easier debugging

## Future Improvements

1. **Deck Sharing**: Allow players to use their saved decks from single-player mode
2. **Extended Game Options**: Add options for deck size, game length, etc.
3. **Spectator Mode**: Allow other users to watch ongoing games
4. **Tournament Mode**: Implement brackets for multiple players
5. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce payload sizes and optimize state updates
